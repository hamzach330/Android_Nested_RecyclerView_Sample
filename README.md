Following Techniques are used to achieve the desired results.
    ** Created a single activity with single recyclerview (MainActivity)
    ** Created a single method named getData() in the main activity to get the data from the Airlineinfos class
        The method is responsible to create a hashmap of all elements starting with the same Alphabet, and sorting the map keys
        in alphabetically before returning the data.
    ** Created an adapter named AirLineListAdapter responsible for rendering the list of data with same Initials.
       Holds the Image of the Airline and the title.

    ** Created an adapter named MainListAdapter responsible for rendering the hashmap of data provided.
       Holds the Header for the Airline and a recyclerview for the corresponding airline list.
